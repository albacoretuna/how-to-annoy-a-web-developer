# How to Insult a Web Developer
A complete guide

## Introduction
Web development is fun. Pushing buttons to make websites, to solve problems is a career that currently about ten million people around the world have chosen. The fun can be ruined in many different ways. Software bugs, browser incompatibilities, colleagues and managers with special personalities etc.
My experience as a web developer shows that there are people out there who try to become very good at humiliating us. Let's give them a guide to make their life easier!

## Chapter One   - If You Are an Employer
Being an employer gives you the power to insult web developers better than anyone else. You probably are already very good at this, but this chapter can help you improve your methods of insulting even the best web developers on the planet very easily.

### Insult them before you know them
As an employer you have the unique chance of insulting web developers before you've even met them! You can insult them by advertising positions that actually never existed in your team, or have already been filled. You can also humiliate them by never answering their job applications, or writing back months later with a generic email: "Dear applicant, unfortunately...". Sky is the limit for you! Let's go to details about insulting methods you can use on each stage.

#### Effective Job Advert
To make a job advert offensive to web developers the first step is listing the name of all the technologies that you've heard or seen the previous developer use as the requirement for the position! Here's a sample requirement list for a web developer position to help you get started:

Requirements

* JavaScript, jQuery
* HTML
* CSS, SASS, LESS
* Backbone.js, React.js, Angular.js, Ember.js
* SQL, NoSQL, MySql, MongoDB
* Scala
* PHP
* Wordpress, Drupal, Typo3
* Node.js
* IO.js
* Flexbo
* SVN, Git

Why this list might do a good job insulting web developers?
The most important factor to keep in mind is that the position shouldn't actually need many of these skills. For example you should require all this for a position that in fact involves only editing some pages on your current Wordpress website. This way you have insulted both people who you will hire and the ones that you don't equally, at least at this stage. Because those who saw the list and didn't apply because of the complexity actually could apply and fill the position. And also the developer who somehow knows about all those technologies will be very pissed off from the moment that understands how simple the tasks are.

Another important factor is insulting web developers by being totally clueless about the technologies you have listed. For example take IO.js and Node.js. They are same technologies are merged back together at the time of writing. You can list them separately, and insist that those are totally different tools. Typos in the technology names help a lot. Instead of flexbox, just cut it to flexbo. It's more fun.

Besides the way you write your job adverts, you can also piss off developers by advertising positions that actually don't exist or are already filled. There are very good reasons to do this. Firstly just because you can! Secondly because you have probably a section on your website to list job ads, if the list is full everybody thinks you're growing fast! On the other hand, if you have the ad there there's a chance that randomly you get applications from top talents! And lastly because you like insulting web developers, right?

#### Effective Processing of Job Applications
To effectively insult developers you have many options as said before. Let's take a closer look at some options.

**Do nothing.** Simply ignore the job applications. Let them pile up in your careers@company.com inbox. Maybe the position doesn't exist at all right?.

**Send back a generic email.** Set an automatic reply on the careers address to send back a generic email to applicants after some time, informing that they weren't good enough. Here's a sample:


     Dear Applicant,

     Thank you for your application.
     Unfortunately we concluded that your skills and expertise aren't the best match for this position. We regret to inform you we won’t be inviting you for an interview.
     I hear you thinking, what a standard reply. Unfortunately I can’t deny that. We can’t do it any other way because of the amount of applications we’ve received for this job. However I can assure you that we've reviewed your motivation and CV and made a well-thought-out decision.
     Thanks again and we wish you all the best and good luck in finding your perfect job!

     Kind regards,
     YOUR NAME
     YOUR COMPANY NAME
