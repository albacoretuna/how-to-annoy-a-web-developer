<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Web development is fun. Pushing buttons to make websites and solve problems is a career that currently about ten million people around the world have chosen. The fun can be ruined in many different ways. Software bugs, browser incompatibilities and the like on one hand, and on the other hand colleagues and managers with special personalities can become a huge part of the annoyance.</p>

<p>My experience as a web developer and reading what others write here and there every now and then shows that there are people out there who try to become very good at annoying web developers. Let's give them a guide to make their life easier! Eventually we'll also collect methods to help web developers cope with the annoyance as well. </p>

</h2>

<p>Being an employer gives you the power to annoy web developers better than anyone else. You probably are already very good at this, but this chapter can help you improve your methods of annoying even the most flexible web developers on the planet very easily.</p>

<h3>
<a id="annoy-them-before-you-know-them" class="anchor" href="#annoy-them-before-you-know-them" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Annoy them before you know them</h3>

<p>As an employer you have the unique chance of annoying web developers before you've even met them! You can annoy them by advertising positions that actually never existed in your team, or have already been filled. You can also humiliate them by never answering their job applications, or writing back months later with a generic email: "Dear applicant, unfortunately...". Sky is the limit for you! Let's go to details about annoying methods you can use on each stage.</p>

<h4>
<a id="writing-annoying-job-advert" class="anchor" href="#writing-annoying-job-advert" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing annoying Job Advert</h4>

<p>To make a job advert offensive to web developers the first step is listing the name of all the technologies that you've heard or seen the previous developer use as the requirement for the position! Here's a sample requirement list for a web developer position to help you get started:</p>

<p>Requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript, jQuery</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS, SASS, LESS</li>
<li>Backbone.js, React.js, Angular.js, Ember.js</li>
<li>SQL, NoSQL, MySql, MongoDB</li>
<li>Scala</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Wordpress, Drupal, Typo3</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>IO.js</li>
<li>Flexbo</li>
<li>SVN, Git</li>
</ul>

<p>Why this list might do a good job annoying web developers?
The most important factor to keep in mind is that the position shouldn't actually need many of these skills. For example you should require all this for a position that in fact involves only editing some pages on your current Wordpress website. This way you have annoyed both people who you will hire and the ones that you don't equally, at least at this stage. Because those who saw the list and didn't apply because of the complexity actually could apply and fill the position. And also the developer who somehow knows about all those technologies will be very pissed off from the moment that understands how simple the tasks are.It also helps if you're somehow clueless about the technologies you have listed. For example take IO.js and Node.js. They are same technologies are merged back together at the time of writing. You can list them separately, and insist that those are totally different tools. Typos in the technology names help a lot. Instead of flexbox, just cut it to flexbo. It's more fun.</p>

<p>Another trick to waste developers' time is by having unwritten criteria. For example, imagine you're a local consulting company in Finland, and almost all your clients are Finnish speakers. But you also like to show that your company is very multi national with offices in every continent. To achieve this, you can write your adverts in English, but simply ignore all all the applicants who have foreign-sounding names.</p>

<p>Besides the way you write your job adverts, you can also piss off developers by advertising positions that actually don't exist or are already filled. There are very good reasons to do this. Firstly just because you can! Secondly because you have probably a section on your website to list job ads, if the list is full everybody thinks you're growing fast! On the other hand, if you have the ad there there's a chance that randomly you get applications from top talents! And lastly because you like annoying web developers, right?</p>

<a id="annoying-processing-of-job-applications" class="anchor" href="#annoying-processing-of-job-applications" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Annoying Processing of Job Applications</h4>

<p>To effectively annoy developers you have many options as said before. Let's take a closer look at some options.</p>

<p><strong>Do nothing.</strong> Simply ignore the job applications. Let them pile up in your <a href="mailto:careers@company.com">careers@company.com</a> inbox.</p>

<p><strong>Send back a generic email.</strong> Set an automatic reply on the careers address to send back a generic email to applicants after some time, informing that they weren't good enough. Here's a sample:</p>

<pre><code> Dear Applicant,

 Thank you for your application.
 Unfortunately we concluded that your skills and expertise aren't the best match for this position. We regret to inform you we won’t be inviting you for an interview.
 I hear you thinking, what a standard reply. Unfortunately I can’t deny that. We can’t do it any other way because of the amount of applications we’ve received for this job. However I can assure you that we've reviewed your motivation and CV and made a well-thought-out decision.
 Thanks again and we wish you all the best and good luck in finding your perfect job!

 Kind regards,
 YOUR NAME
 YOUR COMPANY NAME
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="effective-interview" class="anchor" href="#effective-interview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Effective Interview</h3>

<p>In job interviews you get your first chance to humiliate web developers and see the reaction on their face in real time! But don't get excited yet. There are still things you can do before the interview. By planning the interview right, you can get much better results.
For example, arrange a group interview, instead of meeting one applicant at a time. Group interviews work best at annoying developers specially when you press these nerds with questions like: "what is your biggest weakness?" in front of the whole group. Or invite all the applicants to interview. Before reviewing their technical skills, let human resources spend some time with them, with all of them. Otherwise what is human resources good for? And those applicants don't have much to do anyway. They're looking for a job, it means they've plenty of free time.
Now you can think of what to ask in the interview. Forget about the real position the applicant is going to fill. Focus on finding the best engineers in the world. You deserve to have the best engineers in the world working for you, so don't go for anything less! Head to Amazon and order one of those "1000 Hard Interview Questions" and pick a bunch of question randomly. In the interview, don't waste time getting to know the applicant, just throw them those questions right away and let them struggle.
Also look for signs. For instance if you see the applicant is overqualified don't be too nice, just put it like this:
"If you're really as good as written in your C.V. why did you apply for this position? Everyone is going to treat you like shit".</p>

<a id="annoying-first-few-weeks" class="anchor" href="#annoying-first-few-weeks" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Annoying First Few Weeks</h3>

<p>You have done a great job in humiliating at least one web developer all the way up to this point, and now you have your new team member!
The best way to start the first week at work is to talk about the project and specially the deadline! A situation like this would nail it:
    We currently have a wordpress website, which recently has made lots of troubles, so we need you to replace it with a combination of static pages and SaaS solutions for our dynamic needs. Here's the layout for new pages. The text will be handed to you later, so for now just use lorem ipsum.</p>

<p>Right after this conversation start distracting the developer by</p>

<ul>
<li>orientation days</li>
<li>Ordering new system</li>
<li>Different meetings</li>
</ul>

<p>And while reminding the already passed 2 week deadline, don't provide the text until... I'd say 14 weeks. Meanwhile, don't forget to show up at developer's desk very often to ask how is it going?.</p>

<h3>
<a id="annoying-activities--distractions" class="anchor" href="#annoying-activities--distractions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Annoying Activities / Distractions</h3>

<p>You should know something about developers mentality to do this kind of humiliations on your developers effectively. Generally, and according to stereotype web developers care about the following the most:</p>

<ul>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Computers</li>
<li>Computer games</li>
<li>Board games</li>
<li>Hackathons and maybe tech talks</li>
<li>cat pictures</li>
<li>Anime</li>
</ul>

<p>Your best bet is to never organize events involving such activities. Also it helps to know that web developers are generally considered night persons. Many of them feel very bad early in the morning. So you can mix this two and make your developers come earlier in the morning to do your favorite activities, instead of those listed above, or anything that they are interested in! For example arrange something like: Monthly Breakfast with CEO's childhood friend! and make all your web developers attend it.</p>

<p>When it comes to distractions no one can do it better than you. It might not be directly annoying but it can lead to nice annoys and humiliations. The idea is distracting the developers all through the week, so that they can't deliver on time and then you can annoy them on the next Monday meeting for not delivering!
Keep the office noisy all the time. Don't care about any process and procedure. If something comes to your mind, go to the first developer you see around and tell her what you new web page / web app you need. Don't forget to tell them you need it ASAP. It doesn't matter that they are trying to concentrate on their current tasks, you are the employer, you set priorities!</p>

</h2>

<p>If you are making browsers, it's safe to say that you're responsible not for many humiliations that web developers suffer from, but also for making many of them even change their career! You don't need any tips. You know exactly what to do. But just to make this book longer, let's list the methods you use for humiliating software developers.</p>

<h3>
<a id="have-your-own-reading-of-specs" class="anchor" href="#have-your-own-reading-of-specs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Have Your Own Reading of Specs</h3>

<p>Have a different reading of the Specs. Be special. Let web developers find this sentences at the bottom of every search result:
"Not supported in X"</p>

<h3>
<a id="keep-your-development-process-secret" class="anchor" href="#keep-your-development-process-secret" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Keep Your Development Process Secret</h3>

<p>Put your development process in a black box and lock it! Never let anyone on the outside know whether you're planning to support that feature or not. Let developers do guess work, instead of planning based on your feature plans.</p>

<h2>
<a id="section-3----if-you-are-a-designer" class="anchor" href="#section-3----if-you-are-a-designer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a name="designer">Section 3  - If You Are a Designer</a>
</h2>

<p>Being a designer, you can help web developers make amazing websites with eye catching visual effects. However this won't prevent you to enjoy annoying web developers as part of your job. Here are some tips to help you with that.</p>

<h3>
<a id="never-be-happy-with-the-results" class="anchor" href="#never-be-happy-with-the-results" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Never Be Happy With The Results</h3>

<p>You're a designer. A good one. You should be satisfied only with perfect implementation of your design. The vertical space between the image and the text can always become more balanced, you just have to ask the web developer to push some more buttons. Don't give up! Just keep reminding the web developer that this is not acceptable and should get improved. This could be a good catch phrase for you: "We can't launch like this".</p>

<h3>
<a id="imagine-users-will-spend-hours-looking-at-details" class="anchor" href="#imagine-users-will-spend-hours-looking-at-details" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Imagine Users Will Spend Hours Looking at Details</h3>

<p>Your developer, checking the website analytics knows that users are spending 15 seconds on average on your website. But don't believe that! Design the website so that it had loads of details, and small things to be discovered by users. Push your developer to break many standards and best practices to build those details that probably only yourself will end up exploring!</p>

<h3>
<a id="keep-your-creativity-stream-going" class="anchor" href="#keep-your-creativity-stream-going" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Keep Your Creativity Stream Going</h3>

<p>Don't stop! Bring in new ideas even on the launch day. Never call it final. Always help the developer feel that all the code that he is writing, might end up in trash in a matter of seconds.</p>

<h3>
<a id="live-in-the-print-era" class="anchor" href="#live-in-the-print-era" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Live In the Print Era</h3>

<p>You have been designing amazing stuff from business cards to billboards for years, and everyone loves your design. Keep using standards that you've used and loved. For example if the web developer says "the fold is dead", don't buy it! Insist on fitting everything in the fold, no matter what!
By the way you have been centering any element in photoshop by a couple of clicks. Why the developer can't just center that button for you?.</p>

<h3>
<a id="dont-learn-anything-about-css--html--the-web" class="anchor" href="#dont-learn-anything-about-css--html--the-web" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't Learn Anything About CSS / HTML / the WEB!</h3>

<p>Leave those things to the web developer. That's his problem. You don't have to worry about those things.</p>

<h3>
<a id="expect-mega-corporate-website-quality-from-a-single-developer" class="anchor" href="#expect-mega-corporate-website-quality-from-a-single-developer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Expect mega corporate website quality from a single developer</h3>

<p>If your web developer says "I can't implement this feature now", simply open apple.com and show him how apple has done it. To annoy your web developer act like making a website like apple.com, is as easy as copying their bruchures in Photoshop. It doesn't matter how many team members have worked on apple.com, or Spotify.com, if they can do it, your single developer must be able to do it as well.</p>

<h3>
<a id="dont-care-about-the-developers-craft-or-user-experience" class="anchor" href="#dont-care-about-the-developers-craft-or-user-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't Care About The Developer's Craft, or User Experience</h3>

<p>At the end of the day, it's your design that should shine. Who cares about meaningless code that developers put together to make the design come to life as a website?. Don't compress your image and video assets, and don't let the developer do that for you! Website speed is not your problem, it's users'.</p>

<h3>
<a id="dont-read-this-book" class="anchor" href="#dont-read-this-book" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't Read This Book</h3>

<p>There's a good book titled: "Don't let me think" by Steve Krug. It can give you a good idea about what works and what doesn't for the web. To annoy your web developers, never ever read this book!</p>

<h2>
<a id="section-4----if-you-are-in-devops" class="anchor" href="#section-4----if-you-are-in-devops" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a name="devops">Section 4  - If You Are in DevOps</a>
</h2>

<p>Naturally you help web developers reach their hard earned product to end users. You're the window between developers and users. Just like any other persona we discussed, you can be super nice to developers. But in case you're interested in making their life harder, we have some tips for you as well.</p>

<h3>
<a id="tell-them-to-use-another-tool" class="anchor" href="#tell-them-to-use-another-tool" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tell Them To Use Another Tool</h3>

<p>Is your developer happy using a grunt task? Humiliate them by making them use a task runner written in PHP! For desired effect tell them to do change the tool just a couple of hours before deploying to production! Are your developers all excited about Docker recently? Tell them its not time to consider it for now.</p>

<h2>
<a id="section-5-----if-you-are-an-event-organizer" class="anchor" href="#section-5-----if-you-are-an-event-organizer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a name="organizer">Section 5   - If You Are an Event Organizer</a>
</h2>

<p>So you organize tech events to help the community go forward. Very nice. You have probably a good will. And all that makes it a little hard for you to be able to annoy web developers. But still, if you try hard, there are ways to achieve that.</p>

<p>For example you can always put sponsor satisfaction before the quality of talks. If a company is chipping in well, then it doesn't matter what their presentation is about. It can even be as none-informative as a YouTube commercial. It doesn't matter. Just let poor web developers who have traveled long distances to reach your conference, and also have paid a few hundred bucks for tickets, listen to some repetitive, corporate promoting talks.</p>

<p>On the other hand you can choose your panel so that some parts of web developer society gets offended. For example you can have an all male panel of speakers, and when asked why, reply with a generic: we'd love to have women speak at our conference, but no one applied!</p>

<p>Generally if you don't care about diversity, some web developers might end up annoyed. Just imagine everyone in tech is white, male, straight, and rich. Keep that in mind and you'll succeed to annoy many underrepresented minorities in tech, and people who care about them.</p>

<h2>
<a id="section-6---if-you-are-in-qa" class="anchor" href="#section-6---if-you-are-in-qa" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a name="qa">Section 6 - If You Are in QA</a>
</h2>

<p>If you're the person responsible for quality control, you can of course annoy the poor web developer easily. Just ask her to support any old browser since 1995 onwards. And more importantly, make sure the website looks the same across all those browsers.
Another trick would be trying to convince the art director that the user experience is not good enough, so they should definitely consider a complete redesign. It better be shortly before going live!</p>

<h2>
<a id="section-7----if-you-are-a-web-developer" class="anchor" href="#section-7----if-you-are-a-web-developer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a name="developer">Section 7  - If You Are a Web Developer</a>
</h2>

<p>If you're a web developer you have two main options to annoy web developers. Firstly, you can annoy yourself, or at least your future self. Or you can annoy your fellow web developers! Whether you want to annoy your future self or your fellow web developers, here are some tips for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep the code base dirty and never refactor.</li>
<li>Add any framework / library that you see into the project, you don't have to really need them. Import libraries just because they look good.</li>
<li>Never write comments explaining how your code works.</li>
<li>Even better than the one above, don't update your comments, and sort of lie about your code!</li>
<li>Don't be consistent with your variable names, indention,... Your code should look like if it's written by 10 programmers who don't has never met each other.</li>
<li>Bash whatever technology people in your team are using, and bring in those that you like.</li>
<li>Never write README.MD files for your repos. Let the maintainers Google and guess for the rest of their lives.</li>
<li>Write one word commit messages like: "fixed", "solved"</li>
</ul>

</h2>

<p>Clients of freelance web developers or web development studios have great power to annoy the developers. This comes from the unique relationship between clients and contractors. A contractor really, really wants to do a great job for a client. It makes them happy because it's their craft, it makes the client happy, it makes client's customers happy - and, of course, the developers get paid and can put food on their table. Some surefire ways to annoy a developer as a client:</p>

<ul>
<li>Challenge every aspect of a job estimate.</li>
<li>Ask for estimates for 15 different minor variations of the same scope of work - the most complex of which is barely within the normal minimum project range for the web developer.</li>
<li>When scope of work is agreed upon, try to negotiate down further.</li>
<li>During the review process, be sure to send lots of detailed and finicky updates scattered across many different emails.</li>
<li>Blame the developer for missing some of the changes.</li>
<li>Be sure to freak out that "nothing has been done" when literally every change you requested has been done, except for the one in the file that you didn't actually send.</li>
<li>Give the developer free reign on creating a responsive version with no specs whatsoever...</li>
<li>...and then when you want it changed, say you don't think it should cost extra.</li>
<li>See the <a name="designer">Designer</a> section above, and be sure to hit all of those points as well.</li>
<li>Dispute the invoice.</li>
</ul>
